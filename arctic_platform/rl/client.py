"""ArcticRLClient -- a unified frontend client for HTTP and Ray clients for RL training.

Works identically against a remote dss-platform deployment or a local
``server.py`` instance -- the only differences are ``base_url`` and whether the
client launches the server.

All jobs (training, sampling, log-prob) are initialized automatically at
construction time.
